Robophone Science experiment
This project provides a step by step science experiment for students in different ages.
using the robophone app and arduino ide, we created a project that takes the student from point zero, knowing and learning about the scale, to calibrating the scale using linear equation
to performing the experiment by measuring different types of material using the scale.
by using the roobophone app we make contact with the user, using the andriod phone, and interacting with the user by letting him pick number and choosing which weight he wants to use.
